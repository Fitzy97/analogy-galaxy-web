# Analogy Galaxy Web App
Web app I created for Testingmom.com during my intership there.  Written in React.js.  The only file here that is mainly my work is src, the rest is required for the app to function properly, auto-generated by React, or a build.

# src
## App.css
CSS styles.

## audio, designs, img
All contain media files.

## components
### Home
Home screen for the app.  Pulls up an image for the background and places a button to begin.  Also handles browser resizing.

### Menu
Similar to home, except you can choose level of difficulty.

### Game
Handles gameplay.  Pulls a random question of the selected difficulty from the Testingmom database, formats it, and displays it with the ability to click on an answer to the question.  Nice transitions of correct/incorrect images, audio switch, and hint display.  

### Results
Shows results of the game once the user has gone through 10 questions.
